# This guide inspired by Brandon Authier and his askubuntu post:
# https://askubuntu.com/questions/806820/how-do-i-create-a-completely-unattended-install-of-ubuntu-desktop-16-04-1-lts

# NOTES:
# - The txt.cfg file referenced in this can be found in this directory (gitrepo)
# - The ks.preseed file referenced in this can be found in this directory (gitrepo)
# - iso being used is: ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso, replace with your image name (and path!)

#### Mount ISO and edit files ####

  ## Create directory's
  # For 
  mkdir -p /mnt/iso
  mkdir -p /opt/ubuntuiso

  # Mount ISO
  mount -o loop ~/Downloads/ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso /mnt/iso

  ## Copy over iso files so to a place where they can be edited (it's mounted as read only) ##

  # Copy over files
  cp -rT /mnt/iso /opt/ubuntuiso

#### ks.preseed #### 
# The user/root password need to be added by you. Here is the link that shows you 3 different ways to make a crypt 3 password: https://administratosphere.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/generating-passwords-using-crypt3/
# You may want to change the groups your user is assigned to.
# You will definitely want to change the success_command. I left it to show how it can be formatted and how to use the /target environment.


# Create the new iso:
mkisofs -D -r -V "UNATTENDED_UBUNTU" -cache-inodes -J -l -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -o /tmp/ubuntu16-desktop-unattended-install.iso /opt/ubuntuiso
